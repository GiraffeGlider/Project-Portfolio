This article presents a comprehensive study conducted in a single senior living facility, focused on developing a predictive model to estimate the move-out times of residents. The primary objective of the study was to optimize room occupancy by minimizing the duration that rooms remain vacant after a resident moves out. This is crucial for operational efficiency and decreasing wait time for waitlisted residents. The study employed a simulation model using Excel, incorporating lognormal distribution to simulate resident move-out patterns and align simulated data with existing sample distributions, providing a foundation for the predictive model. This involved generating random numbers using Excel's RAND function, with the creation of 1000 random move-out times, followed by a detailed analysis of their frequency distribution using Excel's FREQUENCY function. This was paired with an Arena simulation to analyze scenarios at 85.5% and 100% bed occupancy, revealing the relationships between bed availability, room turnover rates, and overall wait times simulated for 10,000 days. The findings of the study offer significant implications for senior living facility management, particularly in planning and resource allocation. By accurately predicting move-out times, facilities can better prepare for incoming residents, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and resident satisfaction. The article concludes with a discussion of the model's potential applications in other senior care settings and recommendations for future research to refine and expand upon the predictive capabilities of the model.
