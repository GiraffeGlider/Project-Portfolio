# R Loan Default Prediction Project for fictitious NHB bank
**Collaborators**: Jaiden Angeles, Nathanael Arvy, Sajal Bali, Sebastian Brinkman, Aidan Howker

**Objective:** Develop a predictive model for loan approval post-financial crisis.

## Summary:

- **Code**: Done using Rstudio with R programming
- **Data-Driven Model**: Constructed a statistical model to predict loan default probability.
- **Analytical Techniques**: Employed regression analysis and data binning techniques in R to pinpoint critical variables.
- **Profit Increase**: The model's deployment is projected to amplify NHB's expected profits by a factor of up to seven.
- **Key Variables**: Isolated mortgage balance, years of employment, and income as pivotal predictors of the likelihood of default.
- **Managerial Engagement**: The presentation is tailored to involve managerial staff devoid of modeling expertise, ensuring clarity and stakeholder investment.
