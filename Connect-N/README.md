#Connect-N Game

Author: Jaiden Angeles

##Summary:
- **This program is a console-based game of Connect N, like Connect 4 but with customizable board size and win condition.**
- **It prompts the players for their moves and makes sure they're legal (can't stack pieces too high, can't place them outside the board).**
- **The game keeps going until a player has N pieces in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then declares them the winner.**
