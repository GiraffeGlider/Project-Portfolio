## Summary:

### Hypotheses:

1. **Hypothesis 1:** Does being in a relationship lead to a lower final grade?
2. **Hypothesis 2:** Do highly social students achieve higher grades than their less social peers?
3. **Hypothesis 3:** Does longer study time result in higher final grades?
4. **Hypothesis 4:** Do family factors contribute to higher final grades?
5. **Hypothesis 5:** Do student surroundings influence their decision for higher education?

### Conclusions:

- **G2 (Second Period Grade)** significantly influences the final grade.
- **Quality of Family Relations** positively impacts the final grade.
- Higher absenteeism leads to a **lower final grade**.
- Surprisingly, **longer study time** correlates with a lower grade.
- **Good Health Status** is associated with a lower final grade.
- **Increased Travel Time** to school correlates with a higher final grade.
- Various support factors encourage the pursuit of **higher education**.
