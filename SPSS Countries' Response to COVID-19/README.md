**Collaborators:** Jaiden Angeles, Olivia Kunze, Yujie Yang, Xinyu Zhang

**Objective:** Explore how different countries' strategies impacted their control and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Summary:

- **Data Analysis**: Utilized statistical software including SPSS and Excel for comprehensive data analysis.
- **Key Findings**:
  1. Countries with strict quarantine and social distancing measures managed to control the virus spread more effectively.
  2. Developed countries' mass purchase of medical supplies had a significant impact on the availability of supplies in third-world countries, indirectly affecting their COVID-19 spread.
  3. The presence of women in leadership roles showed varied impacts on the country's ability to manage the pandemic.
  4. Higher healthcare spending did not correlate directly with lower COVID-19 death rates.
  5. Countries with previous epidemic experiences were not significantly better at managing COVID-19 compared to those without.

### Hypotheses:

1. **Hypothesis 1:** Strict quarantine and social distancing measures are effective in controlling COVID-19 spread.
2. **Hypothesis 2:** Developed countries' mass purchasing of medical supplies increases COVID-19 spread in third-world countries.
3. **Hypothesis 3:** Female leadership affects the country's pandemic management effectiveness.
4. **Hypothesis 4:** There is a correlation between healthcare spending and COVID-19 death rates.
5. **Hypothesis 5:** Previous epidemic experiences improve a country's response to COVID-19.
